Over the past couple of months, I've been practicing options trading.  Specifically, selling puts for commission.  I've been learning from the free videos offered by [Option Alpha](https://optionalpha.com) which is an outstanding resource that has tons of content.

One of the lessons that Kirk always talks about is taking profits early.  You can do this by setting up a `GTC` trade to buy back your option spread when it reaches somewhere in the neighborhood of 40-60% of the total commission.  The reason to do that is just in case the trade goes in the opposite direction before the option expires.

I followed that advice and ended up making $5k in paper cash, as opposed to taking a loss.  

But I'm still a novice options trader.  I had options that were expiring very close to earnings,
