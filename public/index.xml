      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge music nerd. I&amp;rsquo;ve played in many bands in my teens 20s, and music is a big part of my life.. I&amp;rsquo;m also a big fan of Pitchfork music reviews.
There was a mashup site I was using called Pitchify, which was no longer updating, and it eventually got taken down. So I did what any engineer would do and I created my own mashup!
12inch.reviews is a mashup of Pitchfork&amp;rsquo;s album reviews with Spotify&amp;rsquo;s web playback SDK.</description>

      <description>I am an avid side project-er. At any point in time I always have at least one “thing” going on in the background that feeds my appetite for playing with new tech and learning new stuff.
Side projects can be liberating and super fun. They are great for your career overall and could lead to great opportunities. These side projects have had an amazing effect on my career, and they can help yours immensely as well!</description>

 Scaled engineering org from 3 to 25+ engineers (we&amp;rsquo;re still hiring). ConvertKit has solid growth. I joined when we were at around $6M in ARR, and I helped scale it to $24+M. Implemented many processes that were nascent or missing - hiring, software delivery, QA, reviews / promotions, etc.</description>
